# NASDAQ-Futures-True-Range-Forecasting
A programme designed to forecast the True Range of NASDAQ Futures

NOTE: This script is for educational and research purposes only. It should not be considered financial advice.
NOTE: The forecasted ranges/percentages may slightly differ from official exchange data, as yfinance was used.

This script downloads 5 years of daily NASDAQ-100 futures data from YahooFinance and calculates the True Range (TR) to measure market volatility. It then applies a 60-day rolling average to forecast the expected range for the next trading day, displaying results in both points and percentage terms. The project provides a simple way to explore volatility forecasting and includes a visualization of daily TR compared to the rolling forecast. True Range was used because it is better than simply (Highâˆ’Low) when gaps matter, which is relevant for futures and overnight moves. A 60-day forecast period is a medium-term smoothing period that balances responsiveness and noise reduction. Below is an example of the ran code. I found the forecasting helped with identifying profitable trading setups for my discretionary trading strategies.
